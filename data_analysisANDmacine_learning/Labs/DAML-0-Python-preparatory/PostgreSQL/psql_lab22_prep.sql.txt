-- Hands-on (Examples)
-- 1. Sum countries’ population, where the first letter is ‘A’
select sum(population) 
from city 
where name like 'A%';


-- 2. Sum countries’ population and percentage (An/A), where the first letter is ‘A’ or ‘An’ 
select A.pop_a, B.pop_an, cast(B.pop_an as float)/cast(A.pop_a as float)
from (
	select sum(population) as pop_a
	from country
	where name like 'A%'
) as A, (
	select sum(population) as pop_an
	from country
	where name like 'An%'
) as B;


-- 3. Cities & countries (name), belonging to ‘Asia’ & city’s population is higher that 4000000 people 
select *
from city inner join country on city.countrycode = country.code
where country.continent = 'Asia' and city.population > 4000000;

-- Alternative solution...
select *
from city INNER JOIN country ON city.countrycode = country.code
where continent = 'Asia' and city.population > 4000000
order by city.population desc;


-- 4. Cities & countries (name), belonging to ‘Asia’ & (optionally) city’s population is higher that 4000000 people
select *
from city INNER JOIN country ON city.countrycode = country.code
where continent = 'Asia' or city.population > 4000000
order by city.population desc;
-- Is it right though?

select *
from (
	select * 
	from country
	where continent = 'Asia' 
) as country_asia LEFT OUTER JOIN (
	select * 
	from city
	where population > 4000000
) as city_4m 
on country_asia.code = city_4m.countrycode;
 

-- 5. Country (code), city (name) & language, having percentage greater than 50% & population is higher than  4000000 people
select cl_50pct.language, country.code, city.name
from city inner join (
	select countrycode, language
	from countrylanguage
	where percentage > 50
) as cl_50pct on city.countrycode = cl_50pct.countrycode 
inner join country on cl_50pct.countrycode = country.code
where city.population > 4000000;

-- Alternative (better) solution
select cl_50pct.countrycode, city.name, cl_50pct.language
from (
	select * 
	from countrylanguage 
	where percentage > 50
) as cl_50pct NATURAL JOIN city
where city.population > 4000000;


-- 6. Country (name) and language (percentage, official) having the maximum percentage and the language is official
select * 
from (select countrycode, max(percentage)
	  from countrylanguage 
	  where isofficial=true
	  group by countrycode) as lang_maxpct
inner join country on lang_maxpct.countrycode = country.code;


select *
from (
	select countrycode, max(percentage) as max_pct
	from countrylanguage
	where isofficial=true
	group by countrycode
) as cl_pct_max 
inner join countrylanguage on cl_pct_max.countrycode = countrylanguage.countrycode
where countrylanguage.percentage = cl_pct_max.max_pct


-- 7. Country & city (names) as well as language, sorted by country’s code
select country.name, city.name, countrylanguage.language
from country INNER JOIN city ON country.code = city.countrycode
	 		 INNER JOIN countrylanguage ON country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode
